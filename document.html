    <p>
      REST is an architectural style that describes how various components
      interact in a distributed hypermedia system
    </p>
    <p>
      RESTful web APIs typically use four of the HTTP request verbs to implement
      CRUD operations: post, get, put and delete
    </p>

    <p>All operations are idempotent, only put and delete are not safe.</p>
    <h1>Create</h1>
    <p>
      <em
        >By create we mean that we add data for a new product item (into the
        database)</em
      >
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>POST</strong> api/phones</dt>
      <br />
      <dd>
        - To create a new phone and save it to the database, you can do a
        request to the route: api/phones
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - The post request is done to the route api/phones and it requests that
        the web server accepts the data in the body of the request message
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - To ceate a new phone, we need the following data in the form of Json:
        brand, model, os, screensize and image. Keep in mind that screensize is
        a number!
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - Example data to send as input: { "brand": "Samsung", "model": "galaxy
        3", "os": "android", "screensize": 4, "image":
        "www.google.com/random-image"}
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - As a response, you get an object with the message succes or the the
        error if one occured.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - When creating a new row in a table with the form we send the data in
        json format, if the table row is created succesfully status code 201 is
        sent out.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt><strong>Responses:</strong></dt>
      <dt>Example output: {message: "Sucesfully added the phone!"}</dt>
      <dt>Code Success</dt>
      <dd>
        - Code 201 Created: we have created the new item to the database, in
        return we could get a success message
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Code Error</dt>
      <dd>
        - Code 400: we have made a bad request, for example, we forgot to add
        the screensize or the screensize is not a number
      </dd>
      <dd>- Code 500: something went wrong on the back-end</dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Content format: application/json</dt>
    </dl>

    <h1>Retrieve</h1>
    <p>
      <em
        >By retrieve we mean that we list the data of a specific item (from the
        database)</em
      >
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>GET</strong> api/phones</dt>
      <dt><strong>GET</strong> api/phones/:id</dt>
      <br />
      <dd>
        - To get data from the server, you can do a request to the uri's above.
        The first one returns all the phones available as an array. The second
        one will give you ONE specific item as an object.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - Example data to retrieve as output (from one specific item): {
        "brand": "Samsung", "model": "galaxy 3", "os": "android", "screensize":
        4, "image": "www.google.com/random-image"}
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - In the second route, you can see that the path contains :id. This
        means that you need to give an id in the parameters. An example would be
        the id 2. To get a phone from the database with id 2, you need to do the
        request to '/api/phones/2'
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - To show the newly created table row we sent a GET request in json. If
        the data for the row is succesfully retrieved status code 200 is send
        out.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt><strong>Response</strong></dt>
      <dt>
        Example output: [{example phone object}, {example phone object 2}] =>
        object as in all the fields like model and os
      </dt>
      <dt>Code Success</dt>
      <dd>
        - Code 200 OK: we succesfully retrieved the items(s)
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Code Error</dt>
      <dd>
        - Code 404 Not Found: there is no existing item with the requested id
      </dd>
      <dd>- Code 500: something went wrong on the back-end</dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Content format: application/json</dt>
    </dl>

    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>
      <em
        >By update we mean that we change the data of a specific item that
        already exists (from the database)</em
      >
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>PUT</strong> api/phones/:id</dt>
      <br />
      <dd>
        - The put request is done to the route api/phones/:id and it requests
        that the server web accepts our new data in the body of the request and
        puts this new data instead of the old data (into the database)
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - To update the phone with for example id=2 as input you need to do your
        request to /api/phones/2
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - To update the phone, just give the new values as an input object. For
        example: { "brand": "Apple", "model": "Iphone X", "os": "IOS",
        "screensize": 4, "image": "www.google.com/random-image"} -> the one we
        created above is now updated
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - To show the new updated row we sent a put request in json. The body
        contains the message. If the data for the row is succesfully updated
        status code 204 is sent out.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - The put call must be used with caution since it's not safe.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt><strong>Responses</strong></dt>
      <dt>Example output: {message: "Succesfully updated!"}</dt>
      <dt>Code success</dt>
      <dd>- Code 204 No Content: succesfully updated the item</dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Code error</dt>
      <dd>
        - Code 400: we have made a bad request, for example, the screensize is
        not a number
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - Code 404 Not Found: there is no existing item with the requested id
      </dd>
      <dd>- Code 500: something went wrong on the back-end</dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Content format: application/json</dt>
    </dl>

    <h1>Delete</h1>
    <p>
      <em>By delete we delete a specific item (from the database)</em>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>DELETE</strong> /api/phones/reset</dt>
      <dt><strong>DELETE</strong> /api/phones/:id</dt>
      <dd>
        - The delete request is done to the route api/phones/:id and it requests
        that the server web deletes a certain item from (from the database)
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - To delete the phone with for example id=2 as input you need to do your
        request to /api/phones/2
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - The delete call must be used with caution since it's not safe.
        Especially to /reset
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt><strong>Responses</strong></dt>
      <dt>
        Example output: {message: "Sucesfully deleted the phone with id 2!"}

      <br />
      <dt>Content format: application/json</dt>
