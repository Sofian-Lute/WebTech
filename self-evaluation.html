    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
      The accessibility and usability of our page is definitely not bad. The things where we succeeded the most in our opinion is our user-friendly layout. <br>
      Any user could scroll through our website and fully understand its content. We made sure to have as little items as possible to maintain a clear website. <br>
      Moreover, our website is accessible to a wide variety of users, it can be controlled all via keyboard only, it can be scrolled through easily via the nav bar and it allows <br>
      users to interact with obvious buttons. However, there is always room for improvements. On our page, for example, we could provide <em>alt</em> tags which allow <br>
      dynamically added images to be understood by a screen reader or we could use more than just colour for highlighting an action.<br>
      These things make it so that the website would be more usable for people who are in need of screen readers and make the website more accessible for people who are colour blind. 

    </p>
    <h3>Accessibility highlights:</h3>
    <p>
      We think that out of all the WCAG rules that we checked, that rule 2.1.3 & 2.4.10 are the most important rules that we pass with our webpage. Passing rule 2.1.3 -Keyboard (No Exception)- <br>
      makes sure that our page is really accessible while only using a keyboard.  Passing rule 2.4.10 -Section Headings- greatly improves usability, because clear section headings that organize <br>
      content make a website easier to understand. Out of the rules that we did not pass we think that the basic rule 1.4.1 -Use of Colour- is most important, because passing this rule. <br>
      would make our website better accessible and usable for colourblind people.
    </p>
   
    <h3>Improvement plan (prioritized):</h3>
      <dl>
       <dt>1. Horizontal page scroll. </dt>
          <dd>To improve usability for people using our website on another divice than a pc, we need to remove the little horizontal page scroll that is present. We need to figure out in css what the culprit is. </dd>
        <dt>2. Foreground/background ratio.</dt>
          <dd>In order to make the website more accessible and usable for colourblind people, we have to make sure the foreground stands out from the background. To do this, we use the contrast check to get a score of at least 7:1. In CSS we will remove the repeating background and make the background a darker colour. </dd>
        <dt>3. Screen size in the form should not take negative numbers.</dt> 
        <dd>To improve usability of our interactive form, we need to make sure that numbers entered are positive numbers. In the HTML file we can add a minimum value of 1 for this sumbission.</dd>
        <dt>4. Generation of alt tags for imported pictures. </dt>
        <dd>To improve usability for people with screenreaders, we need to make a function that generats <em>alt</em> tags. These <em>alt</em> tags wil provide teks with the brand an model of the phones picture. In the javascript file we add to the image in refreshtable a alt which takes the brand and the model for this alt description.</dd>
        <dt>5. Use more than just color to indicate action. </dt>
        <dd>To improve accessibility and usability for color blind people, we need to include other visual clues that indicate that a link has been visited. For this, we can also add differnt underscores in CSS so they know the link has been visited.</dd>
        <dt>6. Changing text size. </dt>
        <dd>To improve usability, make more readable, to get bigger text zoom in on the site. We can fix this by turning font-sizes to em.</li>
        <dt>7. Remove interactive parts for print style.</dt>
        <dd>We need to specify in @media print that nav links do not need to be printed. We can do this by including the nav-link class in @media print and adding display: none; to it. </dd>
        <dt>8. (technical improvements) horizontal white space in css. </dt>
        <dd>We can improve the readability of our code by being more consistent in our use of white spaces in CSS.</dd>
        <dt>9. (technical improvements) wrapping more than necessary in $(document).ready() call. </dt>
        <dd>We can improve our code by only wrapping what needs to be wraped in $(document).ready(). Changes in javasript</dd>
      </dl>
      <ol>
        <li>(not implemented) we could not implement this eventhough we used overflow-x hidden. We do not have enough time to debug what is the cause. We think that it is due to the developer tool, which adds a scrollbar to the right. This might add some more pixels. When testing without the dev tool, nothing is scrollable besides the tables obviously</li>
