    <p>Introduction:<br>
      The accessibility and usability of our page is fine, there are always things that can be better.<br>
      For our page we could provide explanation on how to use the interactive form or use more than just color for highlighting an action.<br>
      These things make it so that the website would be more usable for people who do not understand the form, and make the website more accessible for people who are color blind.<br>
      But there are also good things because of our simple design of the website it is very user-friendly, also for people that only use their keyboard. 
    </p>
    <p>Accessibility highlights:<br>
      We think that out of all the WCAG rules that we checked that rule 2.1.3 & 2.4.10 are the most important rules that we pass with our webpage.<br>
      Passing rule 2.1.3 makes sure that our page is really accessible while only using a keyboard. <br>
      Passing rule 2.4.10 greatly improves usability, because clear section headings that organize content make a website easier to understand. <br>
      Out of the rules that we did not pass we think that the basic rule 1.4.1 is most important, because passing this rule would make our website better accessible and usable for colorblind people.
    </p>
    <p>Improvement plan:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>horizontal page scroll. To improve usability for people using our website on another divice than a pc, we need to remove the little horizontal page scroll that is present.</li>
        <li>screen size in the form should not take negative numbers. To improve usability of our interactive form, we need to make sure that numbers entered are positive numbers.</li>
        <li>generation of alt tags for imported pictures. To improve usability for people with screenreaders, we need to make a function that generats <em>alt</em> tags. These <em>alt</em> tags wil provide teks with the brand an model of the phones picture.</li>
        <li>use more than just color to indicate action. To improve accessibility and usability for color blind people, we need to include other visual clues that indicate that a link has been visited.</li>
        <li>let the user change text size. To improve usability, we can set font-size as a percentage and make 3 buttons to change the font-size to 3 fixed falues.</li>
        <li>remove interactive parts for print style</li>
        <li>(technical improvements) horizontal white space in css</li>
        <li>(technical improvements) wrapping more than necessary in $(document).ready() call</li>
      </ol>
